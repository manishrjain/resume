Desktop Flickr Organizer (DFO) allowed online/offline mode management of Flickr
photos providing more functionality than was possible via Flickr's Web
Interface.

#### About

This application allows online/offline mode management of your photos. You can
upload, search and download photos, through the easy to use interface.

Web based organizer's are moderately slow, updates take time, you can only use
it when you're online. When you have thousands of photos to organize, the time
adds up. DFO on the other hand, stores all the updates offline, and with a
simple and intuitive graphical interface, allows you to be way more productive.
You'll never dread having to organize sets, edit titles, descriptions and tags
for the hundreds or thousands of photos you've accumulated. And you can do all
this editing, when you're just trying to kill your time in train, or that long
plane trip.
